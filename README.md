# Soldat Raggio
Another Ridge Racer 6 based dashboard for the GAWR dash, this one based upon the Soldat Raggio. Like the Kamata dash, there is a gauge peak functionality that will engage once you start driving, and will display when you are completely stopped (0 MPH/KMH), and your seatbelt is disconnected. You'll see the speed start scrolling when the peak is shown.

This repo contains a modified font (I redesigned it to be monospace) as downloaded from here: https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html, here's the license for it: https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG/blob/master/DSEG-LICENSE.txt

# Installation notes:

1) Obtain the GARW dash installer here: https://github.com/dustinsterk/GARWDashUploader
2) You will need to unzip the downloaded dashboard file, rename the folder to "soldat_Main" (Don't use the quotes), and recompress it. (I know, it's a pain)
3) Upload the dash via the uploader while connected to the GAWR Wifi.
4) Follow the rest of the aforementioned instructions.

There are some prebuilt releases for the uploader, check with the Discord Channel here: https://discord.gg/bmKFrt8XP6
